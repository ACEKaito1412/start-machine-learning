# Start Machine Learning in 2020 - Become an expert for free!

## A complete guide on how to start learning machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI) in 2020 without ANY background in the field.

This guide is intended for anyone having zero or a small background in programming, maths and machine learning. There is no specific order to follow, but a classic path would be from top to bottom. If you don't like reading books, skip it, if you don't want to follow an online course, you can skip it as well. There is not a single way to become a machine learning expert and with motivation, you can absolutely achieve it.

All ressources listed here are free, except some online courses which are certainly recommended for a better understanding, but it can certainly be done without it with a little more reading and practice.

Don't be afraid to repeat videos or learn from multiple sources. Repetition is the key of success to learning!

## YouTube_Videos
### Start with short YouTube videos introductions
This is the best way to start from nothing in my opinion. Here, I list a few of the best videos I found that will give you a great first introduction of the terms you need to know to get started in the field.

* Introduction to the most used terms
    * [Learn the basics in a minute - What's AI](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO4GrDnQanVe6F6MRJg_KO7JEoH-ukFzY) - YouTube Playlist
    
* Understand the neural networks
    * [Neural Networks Demystified - Welch Labs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiaHhY2iBX9hdHaRr6b7XevZtgZRa1PoU) - YouTube Playlist
    * [Learn Neural Networks - 3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) - YouTube Playlist

## YouTube_Courses
### Follow free online courses on YouTube
Here is a list of awesome courses available on YouTube that you should definitely follow and are 100% free.

* [Introduction to machine learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU) - YouTube Playlist (Stanford)

* [Introduction to deep learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtBw6njQRU-rwp5__7C0oIVt26ZgjG9NI) - YouTube Playlist (MIT)
    
* [Deep learning specialization](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcIXc5mJsHVYTZR1maL5l9w/playlists) - YouTube Playlist (Deeplearning.ai)

## Read_Articles
### Read many articles
Here is a list of awesome articles available online that you should definitely read and are 100% free.


## Read_Books
### Read some books

## Coding
### No coding background, no problem

## Online_Courses
### (Optional) Get a better understanding and more guided practice by following some online courses



## Practice!
### Practice is key

The most important thing in programming is practice. And this applies to machine learning too. It can be hard to find a personal project to practice.

Fortunately, [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) exists. This website is full of free courses, tutorials and competitions. You can join competitions for free and just download their data, read about their problem and start coding and testing right away! You can even earn money from winning competitions and it is a great thing to have on your resume. This may be the best way to get experience while learning a lot and even earn money!

You can also create teams for kaggle competition and learn with people! I suggest you join a community to find a team and learn with others, it is always better than alone. Check out the next section for that.
